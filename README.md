# Landing-Page

Summary: Created Landing Page Project Based off of ODIN Project Guidelines. Project required me to duplicate a given Landing-Page as closely as possible.

## Repository Comments 

In this repository you will find my html and css files to create a stylized Landing Page. You will also find the font template and desired outcome picture to compare my landing page to. This project tested my ability to use CSS and the flex principal to match an example home page. When examining my code, you will see I divided each section of the landing page into five total sections. Within each section, I modified the content accordingly.  


## Previewing Website:

I have created a github pages to display my landing page. When previewing the site, please resize the window to compare to the desired outcome png as the elements on the page move depending on page size.
